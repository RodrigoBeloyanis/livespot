12_DECISIONS_LOG (PROJECT DECISIONS LOG)

GOAL
Record important decisions and rule/contract changes.
It does not replace the rule files. It exists for history and traceability.

RECOMMENDED FORMAT (SIMPLE ADR)
- DATE (YYYY-MM-DD)
- TOPIC
- DECISION
- MOTIVATION
- IMPACT (affected files and tables)
- RISKS / MITIGATIONS
DATE: 2026-02-01
TOPIC: Go module path
DECISION: Use module path github.com/RodrigoBeloyanis/livespot
MOTIVATION: Align module path with the configured Git remote to avoid local-only module names.
IMPACT: go.mod
RISKS / MITIGATIONS: If the repository origin changes, update go.mod and record the change here.

DATE: 2026-02-01
TOPIC: Config defaults and validation baseline
DECISION: Implement config defaults per 00_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH and add audit_redacted_json_max_bytes=4096; set live_require_ok_file=false with live_ok_file_path=var/LIVE.ok.
MOTIVATION: Stage 02 requires strict config validation and 07_SECURITY mandates a fixed audit_redacted_json_max_bytes default.
IMPACT: internal\config\config.go, internal\config\validate.go, 00_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md
RISKS / MITIGATIONS: If the redacted JSON limit is too small or the LIVE.ok policy changes, adjust defaults and revalidate with a logged decision.


DATE: 2026-02-01
TOPIC: Audit writer queue capacity and SQLite busy_timeout
DECISION: Add audit_writer_queue_capacity=1024 to config defaults and set SQLite busy_timeout to audit_writer_max_lag_ms.
MOTIVATION: Audit sink requires a bounded queue for backpressure and a configured busy_timeout; no explicit values were specified in higher-priority docs.
IMPACT: internal\config\config.go, internal\config\validate.go, internal\config\validate_test.go, 00_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md, internal\infra\sqlite\db.go
RISKS / MITIGATIONS: Capacity too small may trigger PAUSE under load; adjust via config defaults with a logged decision if needed.

DATE: 2026-02-01
TOPIC: Soak mode and readiness report
DECISION: Add offline soak mode with mocked exchange and a deterministic readiness report (config_validated, audit_writer_ok, soak_pass).
MOTIVATION: Stage 20 requires a long soak that validates liveness/health signals without network calls and a deterministic readiness summary.
IMPACT: cmd\soak\main.go, internal\e2e\*, README.md, 10_OPERATIONS_RULES.md, 09_CODE_STRUCTURE.md
RISKS / MITIGATIONS: Soak uses synthetic fixtures and cannot validate live exchange behavior; keep Live checklist and real audits mandatory for production.
